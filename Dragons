<p> A dragon is a mythical creature that appears in folklore of many cultures worldwide. Beliefs and looks of dragons vary between regions,
but most dragons in the western cultures have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable to breathe fire unlike their eastern counterparts who are wingless, four legged, serpentine creatures with high intelligence.
Some common traits between dragons are often a hybridization of Feline, reptillian, mammalian, and avain features. 

In European tradition the dragon is normally depectided as a fire-breather and often tends to symbolize chaos or evil, but in East Asia it is usually a symbol of fertility, often associated with water and the heavens


"Dragon" comes from the Latin draconem, meaning "huge serpent, dragon," which in turn comes from the Greek Drakon, meaning "Serpent, Giant Seafish".
The PIE root derk- "to see" suggests that the  sense of drakon was "the one with the (deadly) glance."
